## Warmup
### FrenchFlag (10 points, 614 solves)
> `Forensic`
Can you find the data present in our flag?

Attachment: flag.png
>

Basic check with `exiftool` reveals the flag at the `Creator` tag.

```bash
└─$ exiftool flag.png
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.40
File Name                       : flag.png
...
Creator                         : dvCTF{flagception}
Image Size                      : 1280x853
Megapixels                      : 1.1
```

Flag: `dvCTF{flagception}`

## ****EBG13**** (10 points, 640 solves)
> `Crypto`
We found this message : can you decipher it?
qiPGS{3apElcg1ba_1f_r4fl}
> 

The flag is encrypted with the ROT-13 cipher, which can be decrypted by shifting each character 13 places forward or with CyberChef.

Flag: `dvCTF{3ncRypt1on_1s_e4sy}`

<br>

### ****QmFzZTY0**** (10 points, 527 solves)
> `Crypto`
Attachment: file.txt
> 

The flag is encoded in the Base64 format and it is revealed after decoding it for 20 times using CyberChef.

Flag: `dvCTF{Base64_Is_The_Best}`

<br>

### MP3 (10 points, 218 solves)
> `Steganography`
The flag in the audio is given without the tag format!
You must fill in : dvCTF{%flag%}

Attachment: MP3.mp3
> 

The flag is spoken out in the MP3 file. Reverse the audio and slow it down to listen the flag.

Flag: `dvCTF{r3v3rs3_mp3}`

First, convert the Hex numbers to Decimal using [https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html).

```
n = 87649082972615446885156213990388141958462041885187282183358321369043253078954716183685582963065012168992348062798954305060720006415266001335650005751863897735171741039420405425935144397447296138110870810719506425543947491726403454512721294407851871180512317063750030012483422248351385763316752934512386876321

e = 65537
ct = 27072622593514815453879432614324701776473574595747953216191498481974488509392434673536099100283731897243171732583922534894433636848515336632487302801454568578704912185172822029407973421574599852974535422485632743936976338461213855442178470548247222162434148032907372865397517157263392748002249405715658427094
```

Calculate the private key and use it to decrypt the ciphertext using [https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher) gives `100118678470123102108521039599861127251114116518811695988695828352125`.

Convert the number to ASCII text using [https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-decimal-to-ascii](https://onlineasciitools.com/convert-decimal-to-ascii) reveals the flag.

Flag: `dvCTF{fl4g_cVpH3rt3Xt_bV_RS4}`

## Steganography
### The Art of Details (50 points, 145 solves)

> `Easy`
A simple detail can make a big difference Always beware of the first element
Warning ! flag format : dvctf{flag}

Attachment: The_Art_of_Details.docx
> 

With the help of the Accessibility function, it showed that there are three images in the document, with a very small size located on the full stop of the first three paragraphs.

![The Art of Details]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/davincictf-2022-details-1.jpg)

Increasing the size of the images reveal three QR codes.

![The Art of Details]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/davincictf-2022-details-2.jpg)

The images can also be revealed and extracted with `binwalk`, as Microsoft Office documents are actually compressed files.

```bash
└─$ binwalk -e The_Art_of_Details.docx 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...
4760          0x1298          Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compressed size: 518, uncompressed size: 518, name: word/media/image1.png
5329          0x14D1          Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compressed size: 723, uncompressed size: 723, name: word/media/image2.png
6103          0x17D7          Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, compressed size: 714, uncompressed size: 714, name: word/media/image3.png
...
```

Scanning the QR code gives the following strings:

```
image1.png: aXRpc25vdHRoZWZsYWc=
image2.png: dGhla2V5ezRBajgyRDZoUlpLQThocXA1dG01fQ==
image3.png: defaw{u1qeuugx&crl0gl_4_r_fbe4a_f4hli0rm}
```

The third string looks like the encrypted flag while the first two strings are encoded in Base64, decoding it gives:

```
image1.png: itisnottheflag
image2.png: thekey{4Aj82D6hRZKA8hqp5tm5}
```

The key seems to be hinting that the flag is encrypted with the Vigenère cipher.

Since digits are not allowed to be in the key, all digits were removed from the key and `AjDhRZKAhqptm` can be used to decrypt the flag using CyberChef.

Flag: `dvctf{v1genere&qrc0de_4_a_gre4t_p4ssw0rd}`

### ICMP (292 points, 85 solves)
> `Medium`
Attachment: icmp.pcap
> 

The data of the ICMP packets in ASCII are in Base64 format and decoding it gives the following.

```bash
This is not a flag!
Neither does this package!
Search a little more, you will eventually find ...
... They wrote a poem :) ...
In fact, the flag is not in this part of the packages, sorry...
```

Well, got to look at elsewhere.

The `id` of the packets look like Hex numbers. The packets are exported as plaintext with the “Export Packet Dissections > As Plain Text” function in WireShark.

First, the packets are arranged according to the `seq` number, then the `id` is extracted and converted from Hex number to ASCII, then decoded as Base64. The flag is then revealed.

```python
import re
import base64
ids = [0] * 32
with open("icmp.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        if("id=0x00" in line):
            seq = int(re.findall(r"seq=(\d+)", line)[0])
            ids[seq-1] = re.findall(r"id=0x00(\w+)", line)[0].decode("hex")
print(base64.b64decode("".join(ids) + "=").decode())
```

Flag: `dvCTF{h1dden_1n_the_1d}`
