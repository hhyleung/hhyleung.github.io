<br>

## 1. A change encountered - personal development
**The only way things are going to change for you is when you change**
- Life is more than just money
- Work harder on yourself than you do on your job
- Apply the information, implement what you learn, work on integrating the ideas into your everyday work
- Human is the only life form that doesn’t strive to its maximum. Why not stretch up to the full measure of the challenge and see all you can do?

<br>

## 2. Live a life of health - total well being
**You should make sure the outside of you is a good reflection of the inside of you**
- 3 dimensional health: body, soul, spirit
- The idea is to get started

<br>

## 3. The gift of relationships
**Time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationship flourishing and growing**
- Gardening: removing weeds
- That which is valuable is hard to get
- Relationships are the backbone of our existence

<br>

## 4. Achieve your goals
**The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it**
- Write it down!
- Achieving the goal itself makes you a better person
- Just decide what you want to do and then get started. That is one of the most powerful lessons in life

<br>

## 5. The proper use of time
**Everyday has many opportunities but only one best opportunity**
- Spend your day wisely: important > urgent
- Either you run the day or it runs you

<br>

## 6. Surround yourself with the best people
**Don’t join an easy crowd, you won’t grow, go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high**
- Who am I around? What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where have they got me going? What do they have me thinking? What do they have me becoming? Is that ok?
- If you become, you can attract

<br>

## 7. Be a life long learner
**Formal education will make you a living, self education will make you a fortune**
- Read books, learn from successful people by observation, constantly reflect on your own experience and learn what went right and what went wrong

<br>

## 8. All of life is sales
**One key to having influence with others is to have others perceive you as a person of talent and virtues**
- Anyone who wants to succeed must learn the art and skills of influencing others
- Never take no as an answer

<br>

## 9. Income seldom exceeds personal development
**What you become directly influences what you get**
- You have to love what you have become, not love money
 - Profits are better than wages: you must work for yourself

<br>

## 10. All communication brings the common ground of understanding
**Communication is two or more people working together to find the common ground of understanding, and when they find that common ground they are positioned to have tremendous power together**
- The most important part about communication is listening

<br>

## 11. The world can always use one more great leader
**To lead others is to help them change their thoughts, beliefs, and actions for the better**
- Bring more value to others by becoming a better leader: leaders talk about what could be
- Optimistic vision: a leader knows where they are, but they also know how to get to a better destination

<br>

## 12. Leave a legacy
**Live a life that will help others spiritually, intellectually, physically, financially, and relationally, live a life that serves as an example of what an exceptional life can look like**
