    <h1>On Histiaeus</h1>
    <p>However, according to Herodotus, Histiaeus was unhappy having to stay in
       Susa, and made plans to return to his position as King of Miletus by 
       instigating a revolt in Ionia. In 499 BC, he shaved the head of his 
       most trusted slave, tattooed a message on his head, and then waited for 
       his hair to grow back. The slave was then sent to Aristagoras, who was 
       instructed to shave the slave's head again and read the message, which 
       told him to revolt against the Persians.</p>

There is a login form with the submit function handled by `login.php`. Looking into the php file reveals existence of `secure.js` and it contains the login username and password `admin:strongPassword098765`.

```jsx
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

The flag is shown on the screen when logged in with the provided user account.

> The website is running [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:49917/).

`index.html` reveals a directory with the file `secret/assets/index.css`. The page `secret/index.html` was accessible.

![picoctf-2022-secrets-1.png]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/picoctf-2022-secrets-1.png)

The page source reveals another directory with file `hidden/file.css` and similarly, `secret/hidden/index.html` was accessible.

![picoctf-2022-secrets-2.png]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/picoctf-2022-secrets-2.png)

Tried to find login information at the page source but instead found another directory with the `superhidden/xdfgwd.html`. The page itself was not accessible but `secret/hidden/superhidde/index.html` was. Ctrl-A was used to select all and reveal the flag in white colour.

> Can you login to this website?<br>
> Try to login [here](http://saturn.picoctf.net:60700/).

There is a login form with the submit function handled by `login.php`. Looking into the php file reveals that the form might be vulnerable to SQL injection.

```php
<pre>username: 
password: 
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name=&#039;&#039; AND password=&#039;&#039;
</pre><h1>Login failed.</h1>
```

The username `admin` and password `' OR '1'='1` was submitted and successfully logged in. The page source revealed the hidden flag.
