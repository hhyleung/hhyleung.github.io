These are last minute cheatsheets I made when I was revising for certification exams. Note that these cheatsheets do not include all topics covered in the exam, but rather a few points/topics that are easily confused or forgotten.

A list of technical certificates that I have obtained can be found at the [certificates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/certificates.html) page.
