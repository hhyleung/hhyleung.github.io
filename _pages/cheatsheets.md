These are last minute cheatsheets I made when I was revising for certification exams. Note that these cheatsheets do not include all topics covered in the exam / course, but rather a few key points / topics that are easily confused or forgotten.

## Cloud
- [AWS Cloud Practitioner]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/cheatsheets/aws-cloud-practitioner/)

## Splunk
