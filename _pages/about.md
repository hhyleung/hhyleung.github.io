Someone who probably has too many interests and always wants to learn a bit of this and that.

For work, I specialise in cyber security, particularly interested in web application security, penetration testing, and digital forensics. Outside the professional area, I enjoy travelling alone in the wilderness, do some landscape and wildlife photography, cooking and baking, playing piano and launchpad, and a little bit of watercolour and oil painting.

I would like to record down my learning journey to keep myself motivated, which is what this website is for, simply a medium that allows me to organise what I have learnt and want to learn.
