Someone who probably has too many interests and always wants to learn a bit of this and that.

For work, I specialise in cyber security, particularly interested in digital forensics, web application security, and penetration testing. Outside the professional area, I enjoy wandering alone in the wilderness to do some landscape and wildlife photography, cooking and baking for family, playing piano and launchpad, and a little bit of watercolour and oil painting.

I would like to record down my learning journey to keep myself motivated, which is what this website is for, simply a medium that allows me to organise what I have learnt and want to learn.

A list of technical certificates that I have obtained can be found at the [certificates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/certificates.html) page.
