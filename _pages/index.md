As someone who probably has too many interests and always wants to learn a bit of this and that, I would like to record down my learning journey to keep myself motivated, which is what this website is for, simply a medium that allows me to organise what I have learnt and want to learn. If anything here happens to be able to help one or two in this big world, then that would be a great bonus!

> Trust the process and try harder.

For work, I started off with [website development](https://hhyleung.github.io/webdev) back in my University days, then got intrigued by cyber security while trying to fix our hacked website. In hindsight, I should probably thank the attacker for hacking us, as that introduced me to this exciting field (sorry for the company, though).

I now specialise in digital forensics and incident response, but I am also interested in web application security and penetration testing. I tend to learn through online courses (mostly video, I'm a terrible reader) and get my hands dirty with labs and CTFs. I also often opt to challenge myself by getting different [certificates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/certified) and when I have the time, I would love to get some small and random [side projects](https://github.com/hhyleung) done.

Outside the professional area, I enjoy wandering alone in the wilderness to do landscape and wildlife [photography]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/photography), perhaps even flying a drone and getting some video editing done afterwards. I also like playing the piano and launchpad, cooking and baking for family and friends, and a little bit of watercolour and oil painting.
