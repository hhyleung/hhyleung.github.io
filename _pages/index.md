I am someone who probably has too many interests and always wants to learn a bit of this and that. I would like to record down my learning journey to keep myself motivated, which is what this website is for, simply a medium that allows me to organise what I have learnt and want to learn.

> Try harder and trust the process.

For work, I started off with [website development](https://hhyleung.github.io/demo) back in my University days, then got intrigued by cyber security while trying to fix our hacked website. In hindsight, I should thank the attacker for hacking us and introducing me to this fantastic field (sorry for the company, though). I now specialise in digital forensics and incident response, but I am also interested in web application security and penetration testing.

Outside the professional area, I enjoy wandering alone in the wilderness to do landscape and wildlife photography, perhaps even flying a drone and getting some video editing done afterwards. I also like playing the piano and launchpad, cooking and baking for family and friends, and a little bit of watercolour and oil painting.

A list of technical certificates that I have obtained can be found on the [Certified Certificates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/certified.html) page.
